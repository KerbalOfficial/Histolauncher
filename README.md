# What is Histolauncher?
Histolauncher is a lightweight, community-driven launcher built to preserve and explore the early history of Minecraft. It provides a clean, modern interface for browsing and launching a massive library of old Minecraft clients - from the earliest Alpha builds to the late Beta era.

The goal is simple: make it easy for anyone to revisit the versions that shaped Minecraft's development, without digging through archives or setting up each client manually. Everything is organized, searchable, and ready to launch with just a click.

Some versions (like the old Java Applet builds) are currently disabled due to technical limitations, but the launcher is designed to grow and improve over time as more features become possible.

If you'd like to contribute, report issues, or help expand support for more versions, you're invited to help!

Histolauncher is a passion project - built for preservation, curiosity, and nostalgia.
Enjoy exploring Minecraft's past!
